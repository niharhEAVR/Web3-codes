### **Viem Library**:
**Viem** is a JavaScript/TypeScript library that provides a high-level, type-safe interface to interact with **Ethereum** and other **EVM-compatible** blockchains. It allows developers to send and query transactions, interact with smart contracts, and more, all while ensuring that the library’s usage is type-safe and easy to understand.

**Viem** is particularly notable for its minimalism, small bundle size, and strong support for TypeScript. It simplifies interacting with Ethereum nodes by managing requests, like sending and reading transactions, with a focus on high performance.

Key features of **Viem** include:
- **Type safety** with TypeScript support.
- **Lightweight** design, keeping the bundle size small.
- **Supports EVM chains** (Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, etc.).
- **Minimalistic API** for making RPC calls to the blockchain.
- **Smart contract interaction**: Call contract methods (read or write).

### **Code Explanation** (How It Demonstrates Viem):

Here’s what the code does and how it demonstrates the **Viem** library in action:

#### **1. Importing Viem functions**:
```javascript
import { createPublicClient, http } from 'viem'
import { mainnet } from 'viem/chains'
```
- **`createPublicClient`**: This function is used to create a **public client** that will communicate with the blockchain. It is the core component that interacts with an Ethereum node.
- **`http`**: This is the transport method used to send RPC (Remote Procedure Call) requests to an Ethereum node using HTTP protocol.
- **`mainnet`**: The main Ethereum network is being specified as the **chain** for interaction.

#### **2. Creating the Viem Client**:
```javascript
const client = createPublicClient({
  chain: mainnet,          // Using Ethereum Mainnet
  transport: http(),       // HTTP transport protocol to connect to the Ethereum node
})
```
- This code **instantiates the client** with the Ethereum **Mainnet** configuration and sets up the HTTP transport to send requests.
- The client will then be able to interact with the Ethereum Mainnet node using the **HTTP RPC protocol**.

#### **3. Creating an asynchronous function `getBalance` to fetch the Ethereum address balance**:
```javascript
async function getBalance() {
  const balance = await client.getBalance({
    address: "0x075c299cf3b9FCF7C9fD5272cd2ed21A4688bEeD",
  });
  console.log(balance);
}
```
- The function `getBalance` is an **asynchronous function** that fetches the balance of the Ethereum address `0x075c299cf3b9FCF7C9fD5272cd2ed21A4688bEeD`.
- **`client.getBalance`**: This Viem method retrieves the balance of the specified address. It sends an HTTP request to the connected Ethereum node (in this case, **mainnet**), and fetches the balance in **Wei** (the smallest unit of Ether).

#### **4. Triggering the function** with a button:
```jsx
<button onClick={getBalance}>Get Balance</button>
```
- The `getBalance` function is invoked when the user clicks on the **"Get Balance"** button.
- When clicked, this will call the **`getBalance`** function and log the balance to the console.

#### **Result**:
- When the button is clicked, the `getBalance` function is executed and fetches the balance of the address from the Ethereum blockchain. The balance is then logged to the console.

### **Summary of Viem's Role in the Code**:
- **Viem** is used here to interact with the **Ethereum blockchain**.
- The code creates a **public client** to connect to the blockchain and fetch the **balance** of a specified Ethereum address using **HTTP transport**.
- By using **`client.getBalance`**, you send an RPC call to the Ethereum node and get the requested data in return.

In simpler terms, this code demonstrates how **Viem** can be used to fetch the **balance** of an Ethereum address via an HTTP-based connection to the blockchain, all in a highly efficient and easy-to-understand manner.
