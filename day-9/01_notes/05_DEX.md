### ** Decentralized Exchange (DEX)**
A **DEX** is a blockchain-based platform that allows users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with one another without the need for intermediaries.

#### **Features**
- **Peer-to-Peer Trading**:
  Transactions occur directly between users via smart contracts.
  
- **Non-Custodial**:
  Users maintain full control of their private keys and funds. Your assets are not held by the platform, reducing the risk of hacks.

- **Anonymity**:
  Often, no Know Your Customer (KYC) or identity verification is required, preserving user privacy.

- **Smart Contracts**:
  Trades are facilitated by automated smart contracts that execute agreements on the blockchain.

- **Supported Cryptos**:
  Primarily supports tokens on the same blockchain. For example:
  - Ethereum-based DEXs (e.g., Uniswap, SushiSwap) trade ERC-20 tokens.
  - Binance Smart Chain DEXs (e.g., PancakeSwap) trade BEP-20 tokens.

#### **Advantages**
- Full user control over assets.
- Privacy-focused; limited or no KYC.
- Lower transaction fees, especially for certain blockchain-native tokens.

#### **Challenges**
- Limited liquidity compared to CEXs.
- No customer support—users must troubleshoot on their own.
- Speed and costs depend on the underlying blockchain.

#### **Popular Examples**
- **Uniswap** (Ethereum)
- **PancakeSwap** (Binance Smart Chain)
- **Curve Finance** (Ethereum)
