Here's a breakdown of the **CEX (Centralized Exchange)** jargons you mentioned, commonly used in cryptocurrency and traditional trading contexts:

---

### **1. Orderbooks**  
- **Definition**:  
  An **orderbook** is a digital ledger maintained by the exchange that displays all buy and sell orders for a trading pair, such as BTC/USDT.
  
- **Components**:  
  - **Buy Orders (Bids)**: Represent users willing to purchase at specific prices.  
  - **Sell Orders (Asks)**: Represent users willing to sell at specific prices.  

- **Function**:  
  Matches buy and sell orders to facilitate trades. The highest bid (buy order) and lowest ask (sell order) are crucial in determining the current market price.

---

### **2. Bids**  
- **Definition**:  
  A **bid** represents the price and quantity at which a buyer is willing to purchase an asset.  
- **Characteristics**:  
  - Buyers place bids below the current market price in hopes of acquiring the asset at a cheaper rate.  
  - The **highest bid** in the orderbook indicates the maximum price a buyer is willing to pay at a given time.

---

### **3. Asks**  
- **Definition**:  
  An **ask** represents the price and quantity at which a seller is willing to sell an asset.  
- **Characteristics**:  
  - Sellers typically place asks above the current market price, aiming for the highest possible return.  
  - The **lowest ask** in the orderbook sets the minimum price at which an asset is available.

---

### **4. Spread**  
- **Definition**:  
  The **spread** is the difference between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price.  
- **Importance**:  
  - **Narrow Spread**: Indicates a highly liquid market with lots of buyers and sellers.  
  - **Wide Spread**: Suggests lower liquidity and higher trading costs.  
- **Formula**:  
  \[
  \text{Spread} = \text{Lowest Ask} - \text{Highest Bid}
  \]  

---

### **5. Liquidity**  
- **Definition**:  
  Liquidity refers to how easily an asset can be bought or sold without significantly impacting its price.  
- **Factors Influencing Liquidity**:  
  - High trading volume and a large number of active market participants.  
  - Tight (narrow) spreads.  

- **High Liquidity**:  
  - Easier to execute large trades quickly.  
  - Smaller impact on the asset’s price.  

- **Low Liquidity**:  
  - Harder to buy or sell without causing price swings.  
  - Associated with wider spreads.  

---

### **6. Market Makers**  
- **Definition**:  
  Market makers are participants (individuals, firms, or bots) that provide liquidity by continuously placing buy (bid) and sell (ask) orders on the exchange.  

- **Role**:  
  - Ensure that buyers and sellers can execute trades easily and without large price fluctuations.  
  - Help narrow the spread, making markets more efficient.  

- **Earnings**:  
  Market makers earn through the bid-ask spread by buying low (bids) and selling high (asks).  

- **Example**:  
  If the bid price is $100, and the ask price is $102, the market maker profits from the $2 spread by completing both sides of the transaction.
