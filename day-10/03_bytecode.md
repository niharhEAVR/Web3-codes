The image explains the following concepts about Solidity and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM):

### Key Points:
1. **Opcodes in EVM**:
   - **Definition**: Opcodes are the basic operations executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
   - Each opcode represents a specific low-level instruction (e.g., addition, subtraction, data storage) that is executed by the EVM.

2. **Bytecode**:
   - When you write a smart contract in Solidity, it is **compiled into bytecode**.
   - **Bytecode** is a binary representation (hexadecimal in appearance) of the EVM opcodes and data required to execute the contract.
   - This bytecode is what gets deployed and executed on the Ethereum blockchain.

3. **ABIs (Application Binary Interfaces)**:
   - Along with the bytecode, an ABI is generated.
   - ABI is a JSON file that defines how external programs (like wallets or decentralized apps) interact with the smart contract. It includes details like function names, parameters, and return values.

4. **Purpose**:
   - **Opcodes**: Execute specific EVM instructions.
   - **Bytecode**: Represents the compiled contract that EVM can understand.
   - **Solidity Code**: High-level human-readable code written by developers, which is translated into bytecode.

5. **Low-Level Execution**:
   - EVM runs only the bytecode, not the original Solidity source.
   - The bytecode corresponds to individual EVM opcodes. For example:
     - `PUSH1 0x60`: Push a constant value onto the stack.
     - `ADD`: Add two numbers on the stack.
     - `CALL`: Perform a function call.

### Simplified Example:

#### Solidity Code:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Example {
    function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) public pure returns (uint256) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

#### Bytecode:
When compiled, this high-level code is turned into bytecode (hexadecimal format), which contains the EVM instructions for addition and other operations.

```
6080604052348015600f57600080fd5b506101708061001f6000396000f3fe...
```

#### Opcode Representation:
Using tools like disassemblers, the bytecode can be turned into a series of EVM opcodes:

```
PUSH1 0x80
PUSH1 0x40
MSTORE
...
ADD
```

This opcode is executed by the EVM when the contract function is called.
