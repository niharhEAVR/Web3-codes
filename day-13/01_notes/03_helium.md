### if helium is not taking any commision then why not trust helium and give them all money to stake?

That seems logical on the surface, but there are **key reasons** not to delegate all your stake to one validator, even if they have 0% commission:

---

### 1. **Network Decentralization**  
- **Problem**: If too much stake is concentrated on a single validator (like Helius), it poses a risk to the decentralization and security of the network.  
- **Impact**:
  - Validators with a larger share of the stake become more powerful in selecting block leaders, verifying transactions, and influencing decisions in a Proof of Stake network.  
  - Centralization makes the network vulnerable to attacks like censorship or collusion.  

---

### 2. **Superminority Risk**  
- **Definition**: In Solana, the **superminority** is the smallest number of validators controlling more than 33% of the total network stake.  
- If Helius receives all the SOL stake, it could single-handedly compromise the **supermajority quorum**, threatening the blockchain’s security.

---

### 3. **Reliability and Redundancy**  
- Validators might experience outages due to software issues, attacks, or hardware failures.  
  - **Helius is not immune to this**, even though they’re reputable.  
  - By distributing your stake across multiple validators, you ensure the **continuous operation of the network** and minimize your **reward losses due to downtime**.

---

### 4. **Validator Behavior Can Change**  
- Helius may be offering 0% commission now, but there’s no guarantee they won’t increase it later.
  - Validators can change their commission rate at any time.  
  - If you’ve delegated a significant portion of your stake to them, migrating to another validator could be slow and costly.

---

### 5. **Reward Optimization**  
- While Helius charges 0%, there are many other reliable validators charging **low commissions (e.g., 1-5%)**.  
  - Staking across validators ensures competitive reward earnings even if one validator's performance declines.

---

### 6. **Decentralized Staking Protocol Recommendations**  
- Solana and other Proof of Stake systems **recommend diversifying stake** to support decentralization and long-term network health.  

---

### Example:
Instead of staking all your funds with Helius:
1. Choose **5 validators** with low commissions, good performance (low skip rate, recent votes), and a track record of reliability.
2. Allocate your stake proportionally, e.g., **25% to Helius**, and the rest across other validators like Galaxy, Coinbase, etc.

---

### Why Trust Matters but Is Not Absolute
Helius might have great performance now, but no single validator should have disproportionate power. Supporting a variety of validators creates a **more robust, resilient, and fair network**.
