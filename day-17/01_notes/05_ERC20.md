When creating a new token on the Ethereum blockchain, you should follow **Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)** for standards to ensure compatibility and functionality within the ecosystem. The most widely used standard for tokens is **ERC-20**, followed by **ERC-721** (for NFTs) and others like **ERC-1155**. If you're creating a fungible token (like most cryptocurrencies), you’ll primarily adhere to the **ERC-20 standard (EIP-20)**.

Here's a checklist of **what to include** and understand when creating an Ethereum token:

---

### **1. Understand EIP Standards**
The **EIP-20 (ERC-20)** defines a standard interface for fungible tokens. These tokens have interchangeable units, like ETH or other cryptocurrencies.

Key Functions:
- Total token supply.
- Balances of users.
- Ability to transfer tokens.
- Approval mechanism for spenders.
- Events for transparency (e.g., `Transfer`, `Approval`).

---

### **2. Key Features to Include**
When writing your Solidity code, you must implement the following **mandatory and optional functions** according to ERC-20:

#### **Mandatory**
1. **`totalSupply`**
   - Represents the total supply of tokens in existence.
   ```solidity
   uint256 public totalSupply;
   ```

2. **`balanceOf(address account)`**
   - Keeps track of how many tokens each address owns.
   ```solidity
   mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;
   ```

3. **`transfer(address to, uint256 amount)`**
   - Transfers tokens from the caller to a specified address.
   ```solidity
   function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public returns (bool);
   ```

4. **`approve(address spender, uint256 amount)`**
   - Allows a spender to spend up to a certain amount of tokens on behalf of the token owner.
   ```solidity
   function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) public returns (bool);
   ```

5. **`transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount)`**
   - Lets an approved spender transfer tokens from one account to another.
   ```solidity
   function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) public returns (bool);
   ```

6. **`allowance(address owner, address spender)`**
   - Returns the remaining tokens a spender is allowed to spend on behalf of an owner.
   ```solidity
   function allowance(address owner, address spender) public view returns (uint256);
   ```

---

#### **Optional (but recommended)**

1. **Constructor for Initial Setup**
   - Initialize the token with:
     - Total supply.
     - Token name.
     - Symbol.
     - Decimal places.
   ```solidity
   string public name;
   string public symbol;
   uint8 public decimals;
   ```

   Example:
   ```solidity
   constructor() {
       name = "MyToken";
       symbol = "MTK";
       decimals = 18; // Similar to ETH
       totalSupply = 1_000_000 * (10**decimals); // Initial total supply
       balanceOf[msg.sender] = totalSupply; // Assign all tokens to the creator
   }
   ```

2. **Burn Function**
   - Reduces the supply of tokens.
   ```solidity
   function burn(uint256 amount) public {
       require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
       balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;
       totalSupply -= amount;
       emit Transfer(msg.sender, address(0), amount);
   }
   ```

3. **Mint Function**
   - Creates new tokens and increases total supply.
   ```solidity
   function mint(uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
       totalSupply += amount;
       balanceOf[msg.sender] += amount;
       emit Transfer(address(0), msg.sender, amount);
   }
   ```

---

### **3. Events for Transparency**
Events allow wallets or dApps to track what’s happening on the blockchain.

**Essential Events for ERC-20**:
1. **Transfer Event**:
   - Emitted when tokens are transferred between accounts.
   ```solidity
   event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
   ```

2. **Approval Event**:
   - Emitted when an account owner approves a spender.
   ```solidity
   event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);
   ```

---

### **4. Security Best Practices**
Security is crucial when writing Solidity contracts. Include these considerations:
1. **Reentrancy Guard**:
   Prevent reentrancy attacks using **checks-effects-interactions** pattern or libraries like `ReentrancyGuard`.

2. **Safe Math**:
   Use Solidity 0.8+, which includes built-in overflow/underflow protection. Previously, developers used libraries like `SafeMath`.

3. **Access Control**:
   Use `onlyOwner` to restrict functions like `mint` or `burn`.
   ```solidity
   modifier onlyOwner() {
       require(msg.sender == owner, "Not the owner");
       _;
   }
   ```

---

### **5. Testing the Contract**
Test your contract to ensure compliance with ERC-20. Include tests for:
- Transferring tokens.
- Approval and allowance mechanisms.
- Burning and minting tokens.
- Invalid inputs (e.g., transferring more tokens than balance).

---

### **6. Deployment**
1. **Compile the Contract**: Use tools like Remix IDE or Hardhat to compile.
2. **Deploy on Ethereum**: Start on testnets like Goerli or Sepolia to avoid costs.
3. **Verify on Block Explorers**: Use Etherscan to verify your contract.
