### **Image 1: Asymmetric Encryption Algorithms**

1. **RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)**:
   - A widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm.
   - Relies on the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers.
   - Common in SSL/TLS for securing internet communication and digital signatures.

2. **ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)**:
   - A more efficient alternative to RSA.
   - Based on the mathematics of elliptic curves over finite fields.
   - Provides equivalent security with smaller key sizes compared to RSA.
   - Commonly used in **Bitcoin (BTC)** and **Ethereum (ETH)** for secure key generation, signing, and verification.

3. **EdDSA (Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)**:
   - A variant of ECC that uses Edwards curves (more efficient than traditional ECC curves).
   - Faster and more secure against side-channel attacks.
   - Used by **Solana (SOL)** and other modern cryptographic systems.

#### **Elliptic Curves**
- Elliptic curves are mathematical curves defined by the equation:
  \[
  y^2 = x^3 + ax + b
  \]
- These curves are used in cryptography because they provide a secure way to perform public key cryptographic operations (like generating keys, encrypting, and signing) using their unique properties.

#### **Common Elliptic Curves**:
1. **secp256k1**:
   - Used in **Bitcoin** and **Ethereum**.
   - A specific elliptic curve optimized for security and performance.

2. **ed25519**:
   - Used in **Solana** and other blockchain platforms.
   - A highly efficient elliptic curve designed for speed and simplicity.

### **Image 2: Applications of Public-Key Cryptography**

1. **SSL/TLS Certificates**:
   - Used to secure internet communications (e.g., HTTPS).
   - Ensures encryption, integrity, and authentication between web servers and clients.

2. **SSH Keys**:
   - Used for secure server connections (e.g., logging into servers, pushing code to GitHub).
   - Protects sensitive operations using public/private key pairs.

3. **Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies**:
   - Public-key cryptography secures blockchain transactions.
   - Used for generating wallets, signing transactions, and verifying authenticity.

### Summary
- **Asymmetric Encryption Algorithms**: RSA, ECC, and EdDSA provide secure ways to exchange information using public and private keys.
- **Elliptic Curves**: Enable compact and efficient cryptography (e.g., secp256k1 for Bitcoin and Ethereum, ed25519 for Solana).
- **Applications**: Public-key cryptography underpins modern secure communications (SSL, SSH) and blockchain technologies.
