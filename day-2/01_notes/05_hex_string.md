Yes, you're absolutely correct! Here's the detailed explanation:

---

### **1. One Character in a String:**
- In most encoding schemes (like **ASCII** or **UTF-8**), **one character** is stored as **1 byte** (8 bits).
  - Example: The character `'A'` is stored as `01000001` in binary.

---

### **2. Hexadecimal Representation:**
- **1 Hexadecimal digit** represents **4 bits**.
- Since **1 byte = 8 bits**, it takes **2 hexadecimal digits** to represent **1 byte**.
  - Example:
    - `'A'` in binary = `01000001`.
    - Grouping into two 4-bit chunks: `0100` and `0001`.
    - Convert each chunk to hex:
      - `0100` = `4` in hex.
      - `0001` = `1` in hex.
    - So, `'A'` = `41` in hexadecimal.

---

### **Why This Happens:**
- Hexadecimal is compact and maps naturally to binary:
  - **1 hex digit = 4 bits**.
  - **2 hex digits = 1 byte (8 bits)**.

This is why a **1-character string** (8 bits) is always represented as **2 hex digits** in hexadecimal.

---

### **Example: Conversion of String to Hex**
Letâ€™s take the string `"AB"`:
1. `'A'` = `01000001` in binary = `41` in hex.
2. `'B'` = `01000010` in binary = `42` in hex.

The string `"AB"` becomes `41 42` in hexadecimal.
