The **Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapse in March 2023** was the **second-biggest U.S. bank failure since 2008**, and it shocked financial markets. Let’s break it down in simple terms:

---

# 🏦 What Happened to Silicon Valley Bank?

## 1. **Who They Were**

* SVB was the **go-to bank for startups, venture capital firms, and tech companies** in the U.S.
* Unlike normal banks with everyday customers, most of SVB’s deposits came from **big businesses and startups**, not small savers.
* Over **90% of deposits were above \$250,000** (the FDIC insurance limit in the U.S.).

---

## 2. **The Problem: Risky Balance Sheet**

* During the pandemic (2020–2021), tech startups raised huge funding and parked that money in SVB.
* SVB invested much of these deposits in **long-term U.S. Treasury bonds** and mortgage-backed securities.
* Normally safe — but these investments lose value when **interest rates rise**.

👉 By 2022, the U.S. Federal Reserve started hiking rates sharply to fight inflation.
👉 SVB’s bond portfolio dropped in value (huge *unrealized losses*).

## 3. **The Trigger: A Bank Run**

* March 8, 2023: SVB announced it sold some securities at a **\$1.8 billion loss** and needed to raise capital.
* This scared depositors (mainly startups + VCs).
* Big investors and VCs told startups: *“Pull your money out — NOW.”*
* Within **48 hours, \$42 billion was withdrawn** — the largest digital bank run in U.S. history.

---

## 4. **Collapse**

* March 10, 2023: U.S. regulators **shut down SVB** and took control.
* Panic spread to other regional banks (Signature Bank, First Republic).
* Stock prices of banks fell worldwide.

---

## 5. **Government Response**

* The **FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation)** stepped in.
* Normally, deposits above \$250,000 aren’t insured. But this time, the U.S. government **guaranteed ALL deposits** to prevent panic in the startup sector.
* Shareholders and bondholders of SVB lost their money, but depositors were protected.

---

# ⚠️ Why Did SVB Fail?

* **Concentration risk** → too dependent on startups (which were already struggling in 2022–23).
* **Poor risk management** → invested heavily in long-term bonds without hedging interest rate risk.
* **Rapid bank run** → digital era meant billions could leave in hours, unlike slow runs in the past.

---

# 🌍 Bigger Lesson (Govt/Economy View)

* SVB showed how **fragile banks can be** when depositors are concentrated and highly connected (startups all listened to the same VCs).
* It revived fears of **2008-style contagion**, but regulators acted quickly to contain it.
* Sparked debates about:

  * Should the government always backstop big depositors?
  * Are other mid-sized banks at risk when interest rates rise?

---

✅ In short: **SVB collapsed because rising interest rates slashed the value of its investments, depositors panicked, and a digital-age bank run drained it in 2 days.** The U.S. government stepped in to prevent wider financial chaos.
