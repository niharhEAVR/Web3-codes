The 2008 Financial Crisis was a severe global economic downturn, and the statement refers to the events that led to and followed the crisis. Here's a breakdown of the meaning:  

### **Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) and the Crisis**  
- **Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS):** These are financial products created by bundling together home loans (mortgages) and selling them to investors.  
- **Problem:** Many of these mortgages were given to people with poor credit histories (called "subprime mortgages"), which meant they were more likely to default (fail to pay back the loan).  
- As defaults increased, the value of MBS plummeted, causing massive losses for the banks that invested heavily in them. This triggered a chain reaction, leading to the collapse of major financial institutions.

### **Wall Street's Role**  
- **Reckless Behavior:** Many large banks and financial firms on Wall Street (the financial hub of the U.S.) engaged in risky practices, such as issuing subprime loans and creating complex financial products without proper risk assessment.  
- **Fault:** These practices were a significant cause of the financial system's collapse.

### **Government Bailouts**  
- **Bailouts:** To prevent a total economic collapse, the U.S. government used taxpayer money to provide financial support to failing banks and financial institutions. This was done to stabilize the economy and prevent widespread damage, such as mass unemployment and loss of savings.  
- **Controversy:** The bailouts were criticized because the banks, whose irresponsible behavior caused the crisis, were rescued using public funds. Many believed this was unfair, especially since millions of ordinary people lost jobs, homes, and savings during the crisis.

In summary, the government prioritized stabilizing the financial system to prevent broader economic disaster, even though the crisis was largely caused by the irresponsible actions of financial institutions.
