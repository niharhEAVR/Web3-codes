Inheritance in Solidity allows one contract to inherit functionality, variables, and methods from another contract. It facilitates the reuse of code and enables developers to create new contracts that build upon existing ones. Let’s break this concept down with the provided example of the `Vehicle` and `Car` contracts.

---

### **How Inheritance Works in Solidity**

#### **1. Parent Contract**
- A parent (or base) contract contains functionality and variables that other contracts can reuse.
- Example: The `Vehicle` contract acts as the **parent contract**.

#### **2. Derived Contract**
- A derived (or child) contract inherits from the parent contract and can reuse or override its features.
- Example: The `Car` contract inherits the properties of the `Vehicle` contract and adds additional functionality.

---

### **Explanation of the Provided Code**

---

#### **Parent Contract: `Vehicle`**

```solidity
contract Vehicle {
    string public brand; // Public variable accessible by anyone

    constructor(string memory _brand) { 
        // Constructor sets the value of brand when the contract is deployed
        brand = _brand; 
    }

    function description() public pure virtual returns (string memory) {
        // A virtual function that child contracts can override
        return "This is a vehicle";
    }
}
```

- **Key Features:**
  1. **Variable `brand`:** Public state variable to store the vehicle’s brand name.
  2. **Constructor:** Takes a `_brand` string parameter and initializes the `brand` variable when the `Vehicle` contract is deployed.
  3. **`description` Function:**
     - **Purpose:** Describes the type of vehicle.
     - **`virtual` Keyword:** Marks the function as "override-able," meaning derived contracts can redefine its behavior.

---

#### **Child Contract: `Car`**

```solidity
import "./Vehicle.sol"; // Importing the Vehicle contract to inherit it

contract Car is Vehicle {
    uint public numberOfDoors; // New state variable specific to cars

    // Constructor that also initializes the parent contract
    constructor(string memory _brand, uint _numberOfDoors) Vehicle(_brand) { 
        // `_brand` is passed to the parent contract's constructor
        numberOfDoors = _numberOfDoors; 
    }

    // Overrides the description function of Vehicle
    function description() public pure override returns (string memory) {
        return "This is a car";
    }
}
```

- **Key Features:**
  1. **Inheritance with `is`:** 
     - The keyword `is` is used to inherit the `Vehicle` contract.
     - The `Car` contract now has access to `brand` and `description` from the `Vehicle` contract.
  2. **New Functionality:**
     - Adds a new `numberOfDoors` state variable specific to cars.
  3. **Constructor:**
     - Calls the parent contract's constructor using `Vehicle(_brand)`.
     - Initializes `numberOfDoors` for the `Car` contract.
  4. **Function Override:**
     - The `description` function is overridden with the `override` keyword to provide a more specific description of a car.

---

### **Flow of Execution**

1. **Deploying `Car` Contract**
   - Constructor requires two parameters: `_brand` for the `Vehicle` contract and `_numberOfDoors` for the `Car` contract.

   Example deployment:
   ```solidity
   Car car = new Car("Toyota", 4);
   ```

   - The parent contract's constructor (`Vehicle`) initializes `brand` to `"Toyota"`.
   - The `Car` contract’s `numberOfDoors` is set to `4`.

2. **Accessing Properties**
   - `car.brand()` returns `"Toyota"` (from `Vehicle`).
   - `car.numberOfDoors()` returns `4` (from `Car`).

3. **Calling `description()`**
   - Calls `Car`'s version of `description()`:
     ```solidity
     car.description(); // Returns "This is a car"
     ```

---

### **Key Concepts in Solidity Inheritance**

#### **1. Function Overriding**
- Use `virtual` in the parent function and `override` in the child function.
- Allows modifying the behavior of parent contract functions in the derived contract.

#### **2. Constructor Chaining**
- The child contract’s constructor must call the parent’s constructor explicitly when it has parameters.
- Syntax: `ParentConstructorName(arguments)`.

#### **3. Adding New Functionality**
- Child contracts can define additional state variables and functions without affecting the parent.

#### **4. Importing Contracts**
- The `import` statement is used to include contracts stored in separate files.

---

### **Real-Life Analogy**

Think of inheritance in Solidity like **blueprints** for a hierarchy of related objects:
- A **Vehicle** is a general category of objects that have certain common properties (e.g., a brand).
- A **Car** is a specific type of vehicle that has all the features of a vehicle but also has unique properties like the number of doors.

### Let’s deep dive into the concepts of `pure`, `virtual`, `memory`, and constructor chaining (e.g., `Vehicle(_brand)`), along with code examples.

---

### **Key Keywords**

1. **`pure` Functions**  
   - A function marked as `pure` cannot read or modify the contract’s state.  
   - Typically used for calculations or utility functions.

2. **`virtual` Functions**  
   - A `virtual` function is one that a derived contract can override.  
   - By default, all functions in Solidity are not override-able unless explicitly marked as `virtual`.

3. **`memory` Keyword**  
   - A Solidity keyword that specifies where data is stored.  
   - `memory` is a temporary storage area used during the function’s execution. The data is lost after the function call.

4. **Constructor Chaining (`Vehicle(_brand)`)**  
   - A mechanism where a child contract explicitly calls the parent contract’s constructor while initializing itself.

---

### **Code Example**

Here’s an updated example that demonstrates all these concepts:

#### **Parent Contract: `Vehicle`**

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Vehicle {
    string public brand; // Public state variable to store vehicle brand name

    // Parent Constructor: Initializes the brand
    constructor(string memory _brand) {
        brand = _brand;
    }

    // Virtual function: Can be overridden in child contracts
    function description() public pure virtual returns (string memory) {
        return "This is a generic vehicle.";
    }

    // Utility function (pure): Doesn't interact with state
    function calculateSpeed(uint distance, uint time) public pure returns (uint) {
        require(time > 0, "Time must be greater than zero");
        return distance / time; // Speed = Distance / Time
    }
}
```

- **Explanation:**
  1. **`brand`:** Public state variable initialized in the constructor.
  2. **Constructor:** Accepts `_brand` and assigns it to `brand`.
  3. **`virtual` Function:** `description` is marked `virtual`, allowing derived contracts to override its implementation.
  4. **`pure` Function:** `calculateSpeed` is stateless (does not access `brand` or any contract variable).

---

#### **Child Contract: `Car`**

```solidity
import "./Vehicle.sol"; // Import the Vehicle contract

contract Car is Vehicle {
    uint public numberOfDoors; // Car-specific variable

    // Constructor Chaining: Calls parent Vehicle constructor
    constructor(string memory _brand, uint _numberOfDoors) Vehicle(_brand) {
        numberOfDoors = _numberOfDoors;
    }

    // Overriding the description function with `override`
    function description() public pure override returns (string memory) {
        return "This is a car.";
    }

    // Function to get detailed car info
    function getCarDetails() public view returns (string memory, uint) {
        return (brand, numberOfDoors); // Reads `brand` from parent contract
    }
}
```

- **Explanation:**
  1. **Constructor:** Calls the `Vehicle` constructor using `Vehicle(_brand)`. Ensures the parent is properly initialized.
  2. **Override with `override`:** The `description` function provides a custom description specific to a car.
  3. **State Access:** `getCarDetails` reads `brand` from the parent `Vehicle` contract.

---

### **Using the Contracts in Action**

#### 1. **Deploying the `Car` Contract:**

Deploy the `Car` contract by providing:
```solidity
Car car = new Car("Tesla", 4);
```

#### 2. **Results After Deployment:**
- `car.description()` returns `"This is a car."` (from the overridden function in the `Car` contract).
- `car.getCarDetails()` returns:
  ```solidity
  ("Tesla", 4)
  ```
- `car.brand()` returns `"Tesla"` (from the parent `Vehicle` contract).
- `car.calculateSpeed(100, 2)` returns `50`.

---

### **Key Learnings from the Code**

1. **`memory` Keyword**
   - Used in function parameters to store data temporarily.
   - Example: The constructor and overridden functions use `memory` to specify where `_brand` exists during the function's execution.

   Why `memory`? Solidity uses `memory` to optimize temporary usage and avoid persisting values that are not needed beyond a function call.

2. **Function Visibility with `pure`:**
   - The `calculateSpeed` function doesn’t access any state variables like `brand`.  
   - The `pure` keyword enforces this by ensuring only parameters and local variables are used.

3. **Constructor Chaining (`Vehicle(_brand)`):**
   - The derived contract `Car` uses `Vehicle(_brand)` to pass the brand to the parent `Vehicle` contract’s constructor.  
   - If the parent has a constructor with parameters, the child must call it during its initialization.

4. **`virtual` and `override`:**
   - The `description` function in `Vehicle` is marked `virtual`, signaling it can be customized in child contracts.  
   - The child `Car` uses the `override` keyword to provide its specific implementation.

---

### **Complete Scenario and Flow**

```solidity
Car car = new Car("Tesla", 4);
```

- **Step 1: Parent Constructor**  
  Initializes `brand` with `"Tesla"` in the `Vehicle` contract.

- **Step 2: Child Constructor**  
  Initializes `numberOfDoors` with `4`.

- **Step 3: Function Access**  
  - `car.brand()` retrieves the `brand` variable from the `Vehicle` parent.  
  - `car.description()` calls the overridden child implementation.

- **Step 4: Stateless Utility**  
  - `car.calculateSpeed(120, 2)` computes `60` as a utility function in the parent.
