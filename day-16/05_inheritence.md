**Create a will contract**
1. Every user will deploy their own Will Contract.  
2. When initialized, set the owner to be the person initializing.  
3. The owner can define a recipient in the constructor.  
4. Owner should be allowed to change the recipient.  
5. Owner should be allowed to interact with the contract via a ping function.  
6. If ping hasn’t been called for > 1 year, the recipient should be allowed to call a drain function.

Here’s a simple implementation of the described will contract in Solidity:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract WillContract {
    address public owner;
    address public recipient;
    uint256 public lastPing;
    uint256 public constant PING_THRESHOLD = 365 days; // 1 year

    event RecipientChanged(address indexed newRecipient);
    event Pinged(address indexed owner);
    event Drained(address indexed recipient, uint256 amount);

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can call this function");
        _;
    }

    modifier onlyRecipient() {
        require(msg.sender == recipient, "Only recipient can call this function");
        _;
    }

    constructor(address _recipient) payable {
        owner = msg.sender;
        recipient = _recipient;
        lastPing = block.timestamp;
    }

    // Owner pings to reset the timer
    function ping() external onlyOwner {
        lastPing = block.timestamp;
        emit Pinged(owner);
    }

    // Owner can change the recipient
    function changeRecipient(address _newRecipient) external onlyOwner {
        recipient = _newRecipient;
        emit RecipientChanged(_newRecipient);
    }

    // Recipient can drain funds if 1 year has passed since the last ping
    function drain() external onlyRecipient {
        require(block.timestamp > lastPing + PING_THRESHOLD, "Ping threshold not met");
        uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
        require(balance > 0, "No funds to drain");

        payable(recipient).transfer(balance);
        emit Drained(recipient, balance);
    }

    // Allow contract to receive funds
    receive() external payable {}
}
```

Let’s go through the code **line by line** and explain what each part does.

---

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
```
- **Explanation**: This specifies the license type for the code. It ensures the code is open source and compliant with licensing standards.

---

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
```
- **Explanation**: This sets the Solidity version for the code. It ensures the contract works with Solidity 0.8.0 or later.

---

```solidity
contract WillContract {
```
- **Explanation**: This defines the contract and gives it the name `WillContract`.

---

```solidity
    address public owner;
    address public recipient;
    uint256 public lastPing;
    uint256 public constant PING_THRESHOLD = 365 days; // 1 year
```
- **Explanation**:
  - `owner`: Stores the address of the person who deployed the contract.
  - `recipient`: Stores the address of the person who will receive the funds.
  - `lastPing`: Stores the timestamp of the last time the owner interacted with the contract.
  - `PING_THRESHOLD`: A constant value representing 1 year (365 days). If the owner doesn’t interact with the contract for this duration, the recipient can claim the funds.

---

```solidity
    event RecipientChanged(address indexed newRecipient);
    event Pinged(address indexed owner);
    event Drained(address indexed recipient, uint256 amount);
```
- **Explanation**:
  - These are **events** used to log important actions on the blockchain:
    - `RecipientChanged`: Logs when the recipient is changed.
    - `Pinged`: Logs when the owner calls the `ping()` function.
    - `Drained`: Logs when the recipient withdraws funds.

---

```solidity
    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can call this function");
        _;
    }
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This is a **modifier** that ensures only the owner can call certain functions.
  - `require(msg.sender == owner, ...)`: Checks if the caller (`msg.sender`) is the owner. If not, the transaction is reverted with an error message.
  - `_`: This represents the rest of the function where the modifier is used.

---

```solidity
    modifier onlyRecipient() {
        require(msg.sender == recipient, "Only recipient can call this function");
        _;
    }
```
- **Explanation**:
  - Similar to `onlyOwner`, this ensures only the recipient can call specific functions.

---

```solidity
    constructor(address _recipient) payable {
        owner = msg.sender;
        recipient = _recipient;
        lastPing = block.timestamp;
    }
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This is the **constructor**, which runs once when the contract is deployed.
  - `owner = msg.sender`: Sets the owner to the address deploying the contract.
  - `recipient = _recipient`: Sets the recipient to the address provided during deployment.
  - `lastPing = block.timestamp`: Sets the last ping time to the current time (when the contract is deployed).
  - `payable`: Allows the contract to receive Ether when it is deployed.

---

```solidity
    function ping() external onlyOwner {
        lastPing = block.timestamp;
        emit Pinged(owner);
    }
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This function allows the owner to "ping" the contract, resetting the `lastPing` timestamp to the current time.
  - `onlyOwner`: Ensures only the owner can call this function.
  - `emit Pinged(owner)`: Logs the ping action.

---

```solidity
    function changeRecipient(address _newRecipient) external onlyOwner {
        recipient = _newRecipient;
        emit RecipientChanged(_newRecipient);
    }
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This function allows the owner to change the recipient.
  - `_newRecipient`: The new recipient's address provided by the owner.
  - `recipient = _newRecipient`: Updates the recipient.
  - `emit RecipientChanged(_newRecipient)`: Logs the change of recipient.

---

```solidity
    function drain() external onlyRecipient {
        require(block.timestamp > lastPing + PING_THRESHOLD, "Ping threshold not met");
        uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
        require(balance > 0, "No funds to drain");

        payable(recipient).transfer(balance);
        emit Drained(recipient, balance);
    }
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This function allows the recipient to withdraw the contract's funds if the owner hasn’t pinged for over a year.
  - `onlyRecipient`: Ensures only the recipient can call this function.
  - `require(block.timestamp > lastPing + PING_THRESHOLD, ...)`: Checks if more than 1 year has passed since the last ping. If not, the transaction is reverted.
  - `uint256 balance = address(this).balance`: Gets the contract's balance.
  - `require(balance > 0, ...)`: Ensures the contract has funds to transfer.
  - `payable(recipient).transfer(balance)`: Sends all the contract's Ether to the recipient.
  - `emit Drained(recipient, balance)`: Logs the withdrawal.

---

```solidity
    receive() external payable {}
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This is a special function that allows the contract to receive Ether. It doesn’t have a function body.

---

### Summary
1. The owner can "ping" the contract to stay active.
2. If the owner stops pinging for 1 year, the recipient can withdraw the funds.
3. The owner can change the recipient at any time.
4. The contract can hold Ether and transfer it to the recipient when needed.

Sure! Let’s break the `drain()` function down **line by line** to understand how it works in detail.

---

```solidity
function drain() external onlyRecipient {
```

1. **Function Definition**: 
   - This function is named `drain`.
   - The keyword `external` means it can only be called from outside the contract (not from within other contract functions).
   - The modifier `onlyRecipient` ensures that only the recipient of the contract can call this function.
     - `onlyRecipient` is defined earlier in the code and checks if `msg.sender` (the caller of the function) is the same as the `recipient`. If not, the transaction is reverted.

---

```solidity
require(block.timestamp > lastPing + PING_THRESHOLD, "Ping threshold not met");
```

2. **Check if Ping Threshold is Met**:
   - `block.timestamp` gives the current time in seconds since the Unix epoch.
   - `lastPing` is the timestamp of the last time the owner "pinged" the contract.
   - `PING_THRESHOLD` is a constant value representing 1 year (`365 days`).
   - This line checks if the current time is greater than `lastPing + PING_THRESHOLD` (i.e., more than 1 year has passed since the last ping).
   - If this condition is not true, the transaction is reverted with the error message `"Ping threshold not met"`.

---

```solidity
uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
```

3. **Get Contract Balance**:
   - `address(this)` refers to the current contract's address.
   - `.balance` retrieves the amount of Ether (in wei) stored in the contract.
   - The balance is stored in the `balance` variable of type `uint256`.

---

```solidity
require(balance > 0, "No funds to drain");
```

4. **Check Contract Balance**:
   - This ensures that the contract has some Ether to transfer.
   - If the balance is `0`, the transaction is reverted with the error message `"No funds to drain"`.

---

```solidity
payable(recipient).transfer(balance);
```

5. **Transfer Ether to the Recipient**:
   - `payable(recipient)` converts the recipient’s address into a payable address (required for sending Ether).
   - `.transfer(balance)` sends the entire balance of the contract to the recipient.
   - If the transfer fails (e.g., due to insufficient gas), the transaction is reverted.

---

```solidity
emit Drained(recipient, balance);
```

6. **Emit Event**:
   - `emit` is used to log events on the blockchain.
   - The `Drained` event is emitted with two pieces of information:
     - The recipient's address (`recipient`).
     - The amount of Ether transferred (`balance`).
   - This helps keep a record of the transaction on the blockchain, which can be viewed later.

---

### **What Happens When `drain()` is Called?**

1. The function checks if:
   - The caller is the recipient (`onlyRecipient` modifier).
   - More than 1 year has passed since the last ping (`block.timestamp > lastPing + PING_THRESHOLD`).
   - The contract has a non-zero balance (`balance > 0`).

2. If all conditions are met:
   - The entire balance of the contract is transferred to the recipient.
   - An event is logged to record the transfer.

3. If any condition fails:
   - The transaction is reverted, and no Ether is transferred.

---

### Example Scenario

- **Initial Setup**:
  - The owner deploys the contract and sets a recipient.
  - The owner pings the contract periodically to reset the `lastPing` timestamp.

- **One Year of Inactivity**:
  - If the owner stops pinging the contract for over 1 year, the recipient can call `drain()`.

- **Outcome**:
  - The recipient receives all the Ether stored in the contract.
  - A record of the transaction is logged on the blockchain.


The `receive() external payable {}` function is a special function in Solidity designed to allow the contract to receive Ether directly. Let’s break it down:

---

### **Line Explanation**
```solidity
receive() external payable {}
```

1. **`receive`**:
   - This is a predefined function in Solidity, specifically for receiving Ether.
   - It is triggered automatically when the contract is sent Ether without any data (e.g., through a plain transfer or sending Ether from an external account).

2. **`external`**:
   - Indicates that this function can only be called from outside the contract, not from within other functions in the same contract.

3. **`payable`**:
   - This keyword makes the function capable of receiving Ether. Without `payable`, the function would reject any Ether sent to the contract.

4. **Empty Function Body (`{}`)**:
   - The function does not perform any specific logic. It simply allows the contract to accept Ether.
   - You can add custom logic (e.g., logging an event or performing an action) inside the function body if needed.

---

### **How It Works**
- If someone sends Ether to the contract without calling a specific function (e.g., using `address(contract).transfer(amount)` or `address(contract).send(amount)`), the `receive()` function is executed.
- If the `receive()` function does not exist, the transaction will fail unless the fallback function (`fallback()`) is implemented.

---

### **Example Use Case**
- Suppose the contract is deployed and has the `receive()` function. A user sends 1 Ether directly to the contract:
  ```solidity
  address(contract).transfer(1 ether);
  ```
  - The `receive()` function is triggered, and the contract accepts the Ether.
  - The Ether is added to the contract’s balance (`address(this).balance`).

---

### **Why Use `receive()`?**
- To make the contract capable of receiving Ether directly, without requiring a specific function call.
- Commonly used in wallets, escrow systems, or contracts designed to collect funds.

---

### **Important Notes**
- If the `receive()` function is not defined and Ether is sent to the contract without data, the transaction will fail unless a `fallback()` function is implemented.
- You can implement both `receive()` and `fallback()` in the same contract for handling Ether and other scenarios.
